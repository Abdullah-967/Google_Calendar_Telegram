## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This n8n workflow consists of several interconnected nodes:

### Core Components
- **Telegram Trigger**: Listens for incoming messages and voice notes
- **AI Agent**: Google Gemini-powered conversational AI with calendar management capabilities
- **Voice Processing**: Automatic transcription using Google Gemini for voice messages
- **Memory System**: Maintains conversation context per user

### Calendar Integration
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Advanced calendar tool integration
- **Google Calendar Tools**: Direct API integration for calendar operations
  - Create events
  - Get events (single/multiple)
  - Update events
  - Delete events

### Smart Routing
- **Message Type Detection**: Automatically routes text vs. voice messages
- **Input Processing**: Normalizes different input types for the AI agent

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Accounts & APIs
1. **n8n Cloud or Self-hosted instance**
2. **Telegram Bot Token**
   - Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Get your bot token
3. **Google Calendar API**
   - OAuth2 credentials for calendar access
4. **Google Gemini API**
   - For AI processing and voice transcription

### Required Credentials in n8n
- **Telegram API**: Create a credential with your Telegram bot token
- **Google Calendar OAuth2**: Create a credential with your Google Calendar OAuth2 access
- **Google Gemini API**: Create a credential with your Google Gemini API key

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Import the Workflow
- Download the `Google_Calendar_Telegram.json` file
- Import it into your n8n instance
- Activate the workflow

### 2. Configure Credentials
Set up the following credentials in n8n:
- **Telegram API**: Add your bot token
- **Google Calendar OAuth2**: Authorize calendar access
- **Google Gemini API**: Add your API key

### 3. Update Calendar Settings
- **IMPORTANT**: Replace the calendar email in ALL Google Calendar nodes with YOUR email address
- Navigate to each Google Calendar node in the workflow
- Update the calendar field to your primary Google Calendar email
- This ensures the bot manages YOUR calendar, not the example one

### 4. MCP Server Configuration
- **SECURITY NOTE**: The workflow includes an MCP server endpoint that you must replace
- Update the MCP Client Tool node with YOUR own MCP server endpoint
- **Do NOT use the example endpoint** - set up your own MCP server for security
- Refer to n8n MCP documentation for server setup instructions

## üí¨ Usage Examples

### Basic Scheduling
```
"Schedule a dentist appointment tomorrow at 10am"
"Book lunch with Sarah on Friday at noon"
"Set up a team standup every Monday at 9am"
```

### Checking Calendar
```
"What's on my calendar today?"
"Show me my meetings tomorrow"
"Do I have anything at 3pm?"
```

### Modifications
```
"Move my 2pm meeting to 3pm"
"Cancel my lunch appointment"
"Update the client call to include video link"
```

### Voice Commands
Simply send a voice message with any of the above requests for hands-free operation.

## üéØ Workflow Logic

1. **Message Reception**: Telegram trigger captures incoming messages
2. **Input Routing**: Switch node determines if it's text or voice
3. **Voice Processing**: If voice, download ‚Üí transcribe ‚Üí normalize
4. **AI Processing**: Gemini agent processes the request with calendar context
5. **Calendar Operations**: Executes appropriate calendar actions via MCP/API
6. **Response**: Sends formatted response back to Telegram

- **Never share** your API keys, credentials, or workflow files publicly
- Review all nodes for hardcoded personal information before deployment
- Ensure proper security for API keys and credentials
- The workflow requires active n8n instance to function
- Voice transcription requires Google Gemini API quota
- **Set up your own MCP server** - do not use example endpoints in production
